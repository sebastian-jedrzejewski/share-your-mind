# ShareYourMind
A web application served as a portal to share knowledge by users. A project realized as an individual project at the Warsaw University of Technology.

# Overview
To run the entire project, it is merely necessary to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
On Linux it can be done quite easily just by installing docker engine (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
On Windows and macOS docker desktop must be installed (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). 
You can run containers using commands in Terminal (Linux or macOS) or Powershell (Windows).

## Run containers
Write this command to set up the entire project:
`docker-compose up -d`

Backend will be available at: http://localhost:8000/
Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000/
